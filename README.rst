snakePipes are flexible and powerful workflows built using `snakemake <snakemake.readthedocs.io>`__ that simplify the analysis of NGS data.

Workflows available
--------------------

- DNA-mapping*
- ChIP-seq*
- RNA-seq*
- ATAC-seq*
- scRNA-seq
- Hi-C
- Whole Genome Bisulfite Seq/WGBS

**(*Also available in "allele-specific" mode)**

Installation
-------------

Snakepipes uses conda for installation and dependency resolution, so you will need to `install conda <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html>`__ first.

Afterward, simply run the following:

``conda create -n snakePipes -c mpi-ie -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakePipes``

This will create a new conda environment called "snakePipes" into which snakePipes is installed. You will then need to create the conda environments needed by the various workflows. To facilitate this we provide the `snakePipes` commands:

* ``source activate snakePipes`` to activate the appropriate conda environment.
* ``snakePipes createEnvs`` to create the various environments and register GATK.

Indices and annotations needed to run the workflows could be created by a simple command :

``createIndices --genomeURL <path/url to your genome fasta> --gtfURL <path/url to genes.gtf> -o <output_dir> <name>``

where `name` refers to the name/id of your genome (specify as you wish).

A few additional steps you can then take:

1. **Modify/remove/add the organism yaml files appropriately** : these yaml files would contain location of appropriate
GTF files and genome indexes corresponding to different organisms. The location of these files after installation can be
found using ``snakePipes info`` command.

2. **Modify the cluster.yaml file appropriately** : This yaml file contains settings for your cluster scheduler (SGE/slurm).
