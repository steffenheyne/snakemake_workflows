ChIP-seq
========

What it does
------------

The `ChIP-seq <https://epigenie.com/guide-getting-started-with-chip-seq/>`__ pipeline takes one or more BAM files and attempts to find peaks. If multiple samples and a sample sheet are provided, then CSAW is additionally used to call differential peaks. Both sharp and broad peak calling are supported.

In addition to peaks, bigWig tracks are also generated.

Input requirements
------------------

The DNA mapping pipeline generates output that is fully compatible with the ChIP-seq pipeline input requirements!
When running the ChIP-seq pipeline, please specify the output directory of DNA-mapping pipeline as the working directory (``-w``).

If you need to provides file **NOT** generated by the DNA-mapping pipeline, then you must provide a directory with the following structure::

    .
    ├── deepTools_qc
    │   └── bamPEFragmentSize
    │       ├── fragmentSize.metric.tsv
    │       └── fragmentSizes.png
    ├── filtered_bam
    │   ├── sample1.filtered.bam
    │   ├── sample1.filtered.bam.bai
    │   ├── sample2.filtered.bam
    │   └── sample2.filtered.bam.bai
    ├── Sambamba
    │   ├── flagstat_report_all.tsv
    │   ├── sample1.markdup.txt
    │   └── sample2.markdup.txt
    └── sampleSheet.yaml


* **deepTools_qc** contains the output of `bamPEFragmentSize <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/bamPEFragmentSize.html>`__ from deepTools, run on all the BAM files.

* **Sambamba** directory contains the output of ``flagstat`` command from `sambamba <http://lomereiter.github.io/sambamba/>`__ (the ``.markdup.txt`` files) and a single file summarizing that with columns ``sample`` (sample name, such as sampl1), ``total`` (total reads), ``dup`` (number of duplicate reads), and ``mapped`` (number of mapped reads).

* **filtered_bam** directory contains the input BAM files (either filtered or unfiltered, however you prefer).

* **sampleSheet.tsv** (OPTIONAL) is only needed to test for differential binding.

Sample configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ChIP-seq sample configuration yaml file describes what type of peak calling to perform on each sample and which sample to use as the `input control <https://www.biostars.org/p/15817/>`__ ::

    chip_dict:
      SRR6761497:
        control: SRR6761502
        broad: True
      SRR6761498:
        control: SRR6761502
        broad: True
      SRR6761495:
        control: SRR6761502
        broad: False
      SRR6761499:
        control: SRR6761502
        broad: False

As you can see above, the same control can be used for multiple samples.

.. note:: Set the flag broad to `True` for broad marks, such as H3K27me and H3K9me3

.. _diffBinding:

Differential Binding analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to perform differential binding analysis between two group of samples, for example wild-type vs Knock-outs, via snakePipes. You would require a sample-sheet and the ``--sampleSheet`` option.

The sample sheet is a tab-separated file with two columns, named name and condition. An example is below::

    name    condition
    sample1 wild-type
    sample2 wild-type
    SRR7013047      wild-type
    SRR7013048      mutant
    SRR7013049      mutant
    SRR7013050      mutant

For comparison between two conditions, the name you assign to "condition" is not relevant, but rather the order is. The group mentioned first (in the above case "wild-type") would be used as a "control" and the group mentioned later would be used as "test".

The differential binding module utilizes the R package `CSAW <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/csaw.html>`__ to detect significantly different peaks between two conditions. The analysis is performed on a "union" of peaks from all samples mentioned in the sample sheet. This merged set of regions are provided as an output inside the **CSAW** folder as the file ``DiffBinding_allregions.bed``. All differentially bound regions are available in ``CSAW/DiffBinding_significant.bed``. The default threshold used by the workflow to test for differential binding is ``p < 0.05``


.. note:: If you name a group of samples as "control" in the sample sheet, the peaks present in these samples would not be used to create the union of peaks for testing. This is useful for conditions where you want to test between two groups, but only on the peaks from one group.

.. _ChIPconfig:

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a configuration file in ``snakePipes/workflows/ChIP-seq/defaults.yaml``::

    pipeline: chip-seq
    configfile:
    cluster_configfile:
    local: false
    max_jobs: 5
    ## workingdir need to be required DNA-mapping output dir, 'outdir' is set to workingdir internally
    workingdir:
    ## preconfigured target genomes (mm9,mm10,dm3,...) , see /path/to/snakemake_workflows/shared/organisms/
    ## Value can be also path to your own genome config file!
    genome:
    ## paired end data?
    paired: true
    ## Bin size of output files in bigWig format
    bw_binsize: 25
    ## Median/mean fragment length, only relevant for single-end data (default: 200)
    fragment_length: 200
    verbose: false
    # sampleInfo_DB
    sample_info:
    # window_size
    window_size: 150

The only parameters that are useful to change are ``bw_binsize``, ``fragment_length``, and ``window_size``. Note however that those can be more conveniently changed on the command line.

Understanding the outputs
---------------------------

The ChIP-seq pipeline will generate additional output as follows::

Following up on the DNA-mapping module results (see :doc:`DNA-mapping`), the workflow produces the following output directories :

* **deepTools_ChIP**: Contains output from two of the deepTools modules. The `bamCompare <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/bamCompare.html>`__ output contains the input-normalized coverage files for the samples, which is very useful for downstream analysis, such as visualization in IGV and plotting the heatmaps. The `plotFingerPrint <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/plotFingerprint.html>`__ output is a useful QC plot to assess signal enrichment in the ChIP samples.

* **MACS2**: This folder contains the output of `MACS2 <https://github.com/taoliu/MACS>`__ on the ChIP samples, MACS2 would perform either a **narrow** or **broad** peak calling on the samples, as indicated by the ChIP sample configuration file (see :ref:`ChIPconfig`). The outputs files would contain the respective tags (**narrowPeak** or **broadPeak**).

* **histoneHMM**: This folder contains the output of `histoneHMM <https://github.com/matthiasheinig/histoneHMM>`__. This folder will only exist if you have broad marks.

* **CSAW**: This folder is created optionally, if you provide a sample sheet for differential binding analysis. (see :ref:`diffBinding`)

.. note:: Although in case of broad marks, we also perform the MACS2 `broadpeak` analysis (output available as ``MACS2/<sample>.filtered.BAM_peaks.broadPeak``), we would recommend using the histoneHMM outputs in these cases, since histoneHMM produces better results than MACS2 for broad peaks.
