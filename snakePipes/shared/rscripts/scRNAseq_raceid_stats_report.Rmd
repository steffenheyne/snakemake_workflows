This report summarizes statistical analyses of your single cell data stored in `r params$outdir`.    

###Cell filtering

The distribution of total transcript counts per cell (TPC) in unnormalized data was plotted.   

```{r}
.libPaths(R.home("library"))

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(params$outdir,"Expdata.ColumnSums.png"))
```

Cell filtering thresholds from 1000 through 5000 by 500 TPC were used to filter cells and count genes expressed in at least 4 cells at at least 2 counts (genes per cell, GPC). The total number of genes in the cell population was counted as number of rows in the filtered dataset.   

The resulting counts were summarized for every threshold.   

```{r}
load(file.path(params$outdir,"metrics.tab.RData"))
knitr::kable(metrics.tab)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(params$outdir,"medGPCvsminT.downscaled.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(params$outdir,"gene_universevsminT.downscaled.png"))

```

###Threshold selection

Cell filtering threshold is selected such that the (first) maximum `r params$metric` is obtained. The underlying reasoning assumes that the maximum value of `r params$metric` retains  `r ifelse(params$metric %in% "gene_universe","most cell types in the data","cells with the highest information content")`. For the current dataset, `r gsub(".jaccard.png","",gsub("sc.minT","",dir(params$outdir,pattern=".jaccard.png",full.names=FALSE)))` TPC threshold-filtered data was further analyzed.

###Cell clustering

Cell-cell distances were calculated using the logpearson metric and selecting most highly variable genes (FSelect=TRUE). Clustering was performed with the default settings. 

Jaccard metrics of the resulting clusters were plotted.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(dir(params$outdir,pattern="*jaccard.png",full.names=TRUE))
```

Tsne maps were calculated with default settings.

Mean-Variance trend of finally processed dataset was plotted.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(dir(params$outdir,pattern="*MeanVar.png",full.names=TRUE))
```

Initial cell clusters were plotted on the tsne map.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(dir(params$outdir,pattern="*tsne.clu.png",full.names=TRUE))
```

###Cluster marker discovery

Top 10 and top 2 markers for each cluster were selected from genes differentially expressed between each cluster and the remaining cells. Fold change of at least 2 and adjusted pvalue of less then 0.05 were required. Obtained genes were reported in tables `r dir(params$outdir,pattern="*Top10markers.txt",full.names=FALSE)` and `r dir(params$outdir,pattern="*Top2markers.txt",full.names=FALSE)`, respectively.
Gene expression of the genes from both lists was plotted on heatmaps. The heatmap of top2 cluster markers is plotted below.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(dir(params$outdir,pattern="*Top2markers.heatmap.png",full.names=TRUE))
```

For the top2 marker list, feature plots and violin plots were generated.


```{r}
png(file.path(params$outdir,"dummy_plot.png"))
plot.new()
dev.off()
fplot1<-dir(params$outdir,pattern="Top1st.+featurePlot.png",full.names=TRUE)
fplot2<-gsub("Top1st","Top2nd",fplot1)
fplot2[!file.exists(fplot2)]<-file.path(params$outdir,"dummy_plot.png")
vplot<-dir(params$outdir,pattern="*violin.png",full.names=TRUE)


knitr::include_graphics(rbind(fplot1,fplot2,vplot))
```
